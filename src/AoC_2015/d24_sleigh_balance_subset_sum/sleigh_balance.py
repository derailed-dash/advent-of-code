Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/24

We require three bags of equal weight. 
    3 groups: one in the middle, and on on each side.
    We are given a list of package weights.
    We must distribute packages across the 3 groups, such that each group has the same weight.
    The central group needs to have the fewest packages.
    If there is more than one solution with equal minimum number of packages,
    then return the group of packages with the lowest QE, where QE = product of package weights
   
Solution for Part 1:
  - Add up the package weights and divide by 3. This is our required weight for each group.
  - We only care about the middle group. The configurations of the other two groups are irrelevant.
  - So, try combinations of packages that sum to the required weight.
    Start with 1 package, then 2, then 3, etc. 
  - The first returned valid combinations will be of the fewest number of packages.
  - If more than one valid combo is returned, find the minimum based on QE.
  
Solution for Part 2:
  - Same as before, but use 4 instead of 3. Easy!
  
This solution works pretty well... About 0.2s for both parts.
