Solving https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/21

Alternating turns for player vs boss.
Loser is first for hit points to reach 0.
Hit points lost = attacker damage - defender armor
(A minimum of 1 hit point lost in any attack.)

Solution:
    Shop class to store all possible items from the shop.
    Shop class determines valid combos of items.
    Build players using all valid combos, and determine the cost of each combo.
    Establish whether the player will beat another player (the boss), by following game rules.

Part 1:
    Determine cheapest winning loadout.

Part 2:
    Determine most expensive losing loadout.
