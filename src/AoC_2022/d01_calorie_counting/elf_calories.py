Solving https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1

Our input data contains lines of numbers, with occasional empty lines.
- Each line is a number, representing the calories for an elf meal.
- Each contiguous block of lines represents the meals for a given elf.
- The empty lines separate one elf from the next.

Part 1:

How many calories in total, for the elf with the most calories?

Solution:
- Read the data, and split by empty lines, to return a list of str.
- Each element is a str containing all the numbers for a given elf.
- Split these numbers, convert them to int with map(), and then sum them.

Part 2:

How many calories in total for the top three elves?

Solution:
- Sort the list.
- Add up the last three.
