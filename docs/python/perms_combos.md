- **Permutations** 
  - A unique arrangement of a group of things.
  - Returns unique permutations of items, including their sequence. So, given the numbers `123`, `123` is a different permutation to `321`.
- **Combinations** return unique combinations of items, ignoring sequence. It is about _members_, not _order_. `123` and `321` are _the same_.

The number of permutations will be greater than the number of combinations.

## Product

We use `itertools.product()` to obtain the catesian product, i.e. the product of every item from each iterable supplied. If we pass two iterables of length `x` and `y` respectively, then the resulting iterable will have length `x*y`.

Also, we can use `product()` with the `repeat` attribute, to obtain the cartesian product of the iterable with itself.  E.g. with an iterable of length `x` repeated `n` times, the resulting iterable will have length `x**n`.

This can be a convenient way of way of iterating through multiple dimensions without writing nested loops.

## Demonstrating With Code

The `itertools` package provides both the `permutations()` and `combinations()` functions.

```python
from itertools import permutations, combinations

def convert_to_num(num_seq) -> str:
    """ Take a sequence of digits, and convert to a single str """
    return "".join(num_seq)

items = list(str(val) for val in range(1,4+1)) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
SELECTION_SZ = 3
print(f"items = {items}")

print("PERMUTATIONS")

# Get all the ways of ordering all the numbers...
perms = list(permutations(items))
print(f"Count of perms with size {len(items)}: {len(perms)}")
print(",".join(convert_to_num(perm) for perm in perms))

# Get all the ways of ordering 3 numbers from these four digits...
perms = list(permutations(items, SELECTION_SZ))
print(f"Count of perms with size {SELECTION_SZ}: {len(perms)}")
print(",".join(convert_to_num(perm) for perm in perms))

print("\nCOMBINATIONS")

# Get all the ways of picking all the numbers, where order doesn't matter...
combos = list(combinations(items, len(items)))
print(f"Count of combos with size {len(items)}: {len(combos)}")
print(",".join(convert_to_num(combo) for combo in combos))

# Get all the ways of picking 3 numbers from these four digits...
combos = list(combinations(items, SELECTION_SZ))
print(f"Count of combos with size {SELECTION_SZ}: {len(combos)}")
print(",".join(convert_to_num(combo) for combo in combos))

print("\nPRODUCT")

# Get all the ways of picking all the numbers...
prod_items = list(product(items, repeat=3))
print(f"Count of product with size {len(items)} and repeats=3: {len(prod_items)}")
print(",".join(convert_to_num(val) for val in prod_items))
```

Output:

```text
items = ['1', '2', '3', '4']

## Rolling Dice Examples

Imagine rolling two dice. 

```python
from itertools import combinations, combinations_with_replacement, product, permutations
 
die = list(range(1, 7))
print(f"One die: {die}")
 
# Cartesian product of throwing 2 dice
cp = list(product(die, repeat=2))
print("\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT")
print("All possible ways of throwing two dice:")
print(f"{cp}\nProduct count={len(cp)}")
 
# All unique permutations (order matters)
perms = list(permutations(die, 2))
print("\nPERMUTATIONS")
print("All unique combinations from two dice. A given number will not be repeated:")
print(f"{perms}\nCount of perms={len(perms)}")
 
# All unique combinations, disallowing the same number twice.  I.e. disallowing re-placement.
combos = list(combinations(die, 2))
print("\nCOMBINATIONS")
print("All unique combinations from two dice, ignoring throwing same on both dice:")
print(f"{combos}\nCount of combos={len(combos)}")
 
# All unique combinations, allowing re-placement
cwr = list(combinations_with_replacement(die, 2))
print("\nCOMBINATIONS WITH REPLACEMENT")
print("All unique combinations from two dice, including throwing same on both dice:")
print(f"{cwr}\nCount of combos={len(cwr)}")
```

Output:

```text

[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]
Count of combos=15

COMBINATIONS WITH REPLACEMENT

```

- There are 36 different outcomes from rolling two dice.  These outcomes can be determined using `itertools.product(die, repeat=n)` where `n` is the number of dice. This returns the _cartesian product_ of our two dice.
- We can use `itertools.permutations(die, n)` to get all unique permutations of the two die rolls.
  - The results `(1,6)` and `(6,1)` are considered two different permutations.
  - Note that we only get 30 permutations.  This is because _permutations_ do not allow repeating numbers. E.g. it disallows `(1,1)`, `(2,2)`, etc. 
  - It is possible to determine _permutations with repeats_.  This is in fact equivalent to the _cartesian product_.
- If we ignore order, then `(1,2)` and `(2,1)` are the same. We use `itertools.combinations(die, n)` to determine all these combinations.
  - By default, repeating numbers are excluded. E.g. `(1,1)`, `(2,2)`, etc.
  - We can allow repeated numbers by using the method `combinations_with_replacement(die, 2)`. This this method gives more combinations.

## Chain

We can use `itertools.chain(*iterables)` to combine multiple iterables into a single iterator, effectively chaining them together into a continuous sequence. It iterates over each iterable in order, one element at a time. We use itertools.chain() when you want to iterate over multiple iterables as if they were a single sequence.

```python
colors = ['red', 'blue']
sizes  = ['small', 'large']

# Chain the two iterables
chained_iterables = itertools.chain(colors, sizes)

# Iterate over the chained iterables and print the elements
for item in chained_iterables:
    print(item)
```

Output:

```text
red
blue
small
large
```

## Cycle

We use `itertools.cycle(iterable)` to infinitely iterate through the elements of an iterable. Once we reach the end of the iterale, we start back at the beginning. It returns an infinite generator.

E.g.

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

# Create a cycle iterator from the list
color_cycle = itertools.cycle(colors)

# Iterate over the cycle and print the elements
for _ in range(6):
    print(next(color_cycle))
```

Output:

```text
red
green
blue
red
green
blue
```
