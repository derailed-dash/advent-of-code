## What is SymPy?

SymPy is so cool!  I came across when I was trying to solve some equations as part of 2023 AoC puzzles. It is computer alegebra systems (CAS): a library that allows us to perform algebra and mathematical computations. 

You can use it for things like:

- Simplifying, rearranging, factoring and expanding algebraic expressions and equations.
- Solving equations of various types, including linear, polynomial, and differential.
- Performing calculus, including differentiation and integration.
- Plotting graphs.
- Generating LaTeX output.

## Basic Examples

### Simplifying and Expanding

We need to define variables before we can use them in SymPy. We do this by creating `symbols`.

One interesting observation here is that when you evaluate a SymPy expression a Jupyter notebook, it is rendered in _pretty-printed_ (mathematical) format. But when we print using `print()`, it is printed in conventional Python style.

If you want to explicitly pretty-print from a Python notebook, you can use `IPython.display`.

Alternatively, you can optionally run `init_printing()` to enable the best printer for your environment. Or run `init_session()` to automatically import everything in SymPy, create some common Symbols, setup plotting, and run `init_printing()`.

```python
import sympy
from sympy import latex
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

sympy.init_session() # set up default behaviour and printing - not essential

a, b, x, y = sympy.symbols("a b x y") # define symbols (variables)
a = (x + 1)**2 # set a to be an expression
b = x**2 + 2*x + 1 # set b to be an equivalent expression
display(Markdown(f"$a = {latex(a)}$")) # pretty-print a
print(f"{latex('a = ')}{latex(a)}") # If we just want the raw latex

display(Markdown(f"$b = {latex(b)}$")) # pretty-print b

# Expand a...
display(Markdown("Expanding $a$..."))
expanded = sympy.expand(a)
display(Markdown(f"$a = {latex(expanded)}$"))

# Show a-b without simplifying...
a_minus_b = a-b
display(Markdown(f"$a-b = {latex(a_minus_b)}$"))

# Simplify...
display(Markdown("Simplifying..."))
display(Markdown(f"$a-b$ $= {latex(sympy.simplify(a_minus_b))}$"))
```

We can also test if two expressions are the same, e.g.

```python
a.equals(b)
```

### Assigning Variables and Evaluating

You can't simply assign values to the Python variable. If you did so, they would cease to be a symbol. Instead, you need to use `subs()` to associate a value with a SymPy symbol.

```python
x, y = sympy.symbols("x y")
expr = x+y
result = expr.subs({x: 2, y: 5})
print(f"{expr=}, {result=}")
```

### Differentiation and Integration

```python
import sympy

x = sympy.symbols("x")
expr = x**2

deriv = sympy.diff(expr)
print(deriv)

integral = sympy.integrate(deriv)
print(integral)
```

![SymPy basics](/assets/images/sympy_basics.png)

### Solving Quadratics

Here, I use `solve()` to determine the values of $x$. I've specified `dict=True` such that $x$ can be retrieved by passing its symbol as a dictionary key to the returned `solutions` dictionary.

```python
expr = x**2 + 3*x - 10
solutions = sympy.solve(expr, x, dict=True)
solutions

for solution in solutions:
    print(f"x={solution[x]}")
```

Note that the expressions still need to be written in valid Python. So we can write `3*x`, but we can't write `3x`.

### Including Only Real Solutions

What if you want to ignore _complex_ solutions and only include _real_ solutions? In this case, you can use `solveset()`, and specify the domain as `domain=sympy.S.Reals`. (Whereas `domain=S.Complexes` is the default.)

```python
expressions = []
expressions.append(x**2 - 9) # there are only real solutions
expressions.append(x**2 + 9) # there are only complex solutions

for expr in expressions:
    display(expr)
    solutions = sympy.solveset(expr, x)
    print(f"There are {len(solutions)} solutions for x...")
    display(solutions)

display(expressions[-1])
solutions = sympy.solveset(expressions[-1], x, domain=sympy.S.Reals)
print(f"There are {len(solutions)} real solutions for x.")
```

### Evaluating to Obtain Numeric Values

We can evaluate to obtain the float value of a symbol, and display to an arbitrary level of precision: 

```python
expr = sympy.sqrt(8)
display(expr)
display(expr.evalf(4)) # to 4 digits of precisions
```

## AoC Examples

### Boat Racing Quadratic

In this example taken from [2023 Day 6](https://colab.research.google.com/github/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code/blob/master/src/AoC_2023/Dazbo's_Advent_of_Code_2023.ipynb#scrollTo=2jT8WTv-Cfgo){:target="_blank"}, I'm solving a quadratic:

$$
h^2 - th + d = 0
$$

```python
def solve_part2_sympy_quadratic(data):
    """ h^2 - th + d = 0 """
    race_duration = int("".join(x for x in data[0].split(":")[1].split()))
    distance = int("".join(x for x in data[1].split(":")[1].split()))
    logger.debug(f"{race_duration=}, {distance=}")  

    # solve using quadratic with SymPy       
    h = sympy.symbols("h", real=True)
    equation = sympy.Eq(h**2 - race_duration*h + distance, 0)
    solutions = sympy.solve(equation, h, dict=True)
    answers = [solution[h].evalf() for solution in solutions] # there should be two
```

### Trajectory Intersection

In this example taken from [2023 Day 24](https://colab.research.google.com/github/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code/blob/master/src/AoC_2023/Dazbo's_Advent_of_Code_2023.ipynb#scrollTo=9agx4CcYCfhR){:target="_blank"}, I have a series of equations that are necessary to find several unknown variables. Specifically:

$$
\begin{align}
t &= \frac{x_{r} - x_{h}}{v_{x_{h}} - v_{x_{r}}} = \frac{y_{r} - y_{h}}{v_{y_{h}} - v_{y_{r}}} = \frac{z_{r} - z_{h}}{v_{z_{h}} - v_{z_{r}}} \\
\notag \\
(x_{r} - x_{h})(v_{y_{h}} - v_{y_{r}}) &= (y_{r} - y_{h})(v_{x_{h}} - v_{x_{r}}) \\
(y_{r} - y_{h})(v_{z_{h}} - v_{z_{r}}) &= (z_{r} - z_{h})(v_{y_{h}} - v_{y_{r}}) \\
(z_{r} - z_{h})(v_{x_{h}} - v_{x_{r}}) &= (x_{r} - x_{h})(v_{z_{h}} - v_{z_{r}}) \\
\end{align}
$$

And here's the code:

```python
def solve_part2(data: list[str]):
    """ 
    Determine the sum of the rock's (x,y,z) coordinate at t=0, for a rock that will hit every hailstone
    in our input data. The rock has constant velocity and is not affected by collisions.
    """
    stones = parse_stones(data)
    logger.debug(f"We have {len(stones)} stones.")
    
    # define SymPy rock symbols - these are our unknowns representing:
    # initial rock location (xr, yr, zr)
    # rock velocity (vxr, vyr, vzr)
    xr, yr, zr, vxr, vyr, vzr = sympy.symbols("xr yr zr vxr vyr vzr")
    
    equations = [] # we assemble a set of equations that must be true
    for stone in stones[:10]: # we don't need ALL the stones to find a solution. We need just enough.
        x, y, z = stone.posn
        vx, vy, vz = stone.velocity
        equations.append(sympy.Eq((xr-x)*(vy-vyr), (yr-y)*(vx-vxr)))
        equations.append(sympy.Eq((yr-y)*(vz-vzr), (zr-z)*(vy-vyr)))

    solutions = sympy.solve(equations, dict=True) # SymPy does the hard work
    if solutions:
        solution = solutions[0]
        logger.info(solution)
        return sum([solution[xr], solution[yr], solution[zr]])
    
    logger.info("No solutions found.")
    return None
```
