**Sets** are really useful when we want to store a number of unique items, but we don't care about the order of those items.

Python sets have these attributes:

- They cannot contain duplicate items.  Adding a duplicate item simply does nothing.
- The items in the set must be _immutable_. I.e. objects that can't be modified and which are _hashable_. For this reason, it can be extremely convenient to use the [dataclass](/python/classes#dataclass) when defining your own objects for use in sets, with the `frozen=True` attribute set.
- Items in the set are _unordered_. Thus, items are not _indexable_.  (Though, if you want an ordered set, you can create your own implementation.)

You should consider using sets whenever you need to:

- Count how many items in a collection are unique.
- Perform set algebra, such as:
  - Determine if an object already exists in another set (membership).
  - Determine which items overlap, across two different sets.

## Quick Demo

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point():
    """ Point class, which stores x and y """
    x: int
    y: int
    
point_a = (5, 10)
point_b = (6, 5)
point_c = (5, 10)   # this is a duplicate (non-unique) point
point_d = (20, 30)

points = set()
points.add(point_a)
points.add(point_b)
points.add(point_c)

print(f"Points contains {len(points)} points.")   # We've only added 2 unique points

print(f"Point c is in points? {point_c in points}")  # Because c and a are actually the same
print(f"Point d is in points? {point_d in points}")  # We haven't added this

# We can make a points list like this...
points_list = [point_a, point_b, point_c, point_d]  # 4 items
print(f"Points_list contains {len(points_list)} points.")   # still four items
print(f"Points_list: {points_list}")

# And now we can convert it to a set
# This is a convenient way to strip out duplicates from any collection!
points_set = set(points_list)
print(f"Points_set contains {len(points_set)} points.")   # now 3 items
print(f"Points_set: {points_set}")
```

Output:

```text
Points contains 2 points.
Point c is in points? True
Point d is in points? False
Points_list contains 4 points.
Points_list: [(5, 10), (6, 5), (5, 10), (20, 30)]
Points_set contains 3 points.
Points_set: {(5, 10), (20, 30), (6, 5)}
```

## Set Algebra

Mathematical _set algebra_ is easily achieved using Python sets. For example, we can use set algebra to determine when one `set` _contains_ another `set`, any _intersection_ of sets, any _difference_ between sets, and any _union_ that is created by combining sets. If you're unfamiliar with _set theory_, but you understand **Venn diagrams**, then guess what... You pretty much understand _set theory!_
