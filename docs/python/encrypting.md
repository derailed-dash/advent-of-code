## Don't Share Your Input Data

Input data is unique to users. The input data that I am assigned (for any given AoC puzzle) will be different to the input data that you see.

Eric, the creator of Advent of Code, has requested that participants do not share their input data. As described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/){:target="_blank"}, sharing the input files would make it easier for someone to steal the entire AoC site.  AoC is an immensely valuable and useful creation, and we don't want to help any freeloaders to steal the intellectual property into which Eric has put so much time and effort.

## What To Do?

Personally, I always want to be able to store my input data, along with my solution. That way, I can synchronise my repo across multiple devices, and be sure I'm always working with the same input data.

Furthermore, I want to share my solutions with all of you. And as such, my [repo](https://github.com/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code){:target="_blank"} is public. But I don't want to share my input data with anyone else.

My solution: **encrypt the input data.**

## How to Encrypt?

There are many ways to encrypt data that you check-in to GitHub.  But one method I like is [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt){:target="_blank"}. Git-Crypt performs **transparent encryption and decryption** of selected files, when pushing/pulling from your GitHub repo, respectively. Thus, once you've set it up, you don't need to do anything. It just works.

## Working with Git-Crypt

### Installation

First, you'll need to install Git-Crypt. On Linux (or Linux on Windows using WSL):

```bash
sudo apt install git-crypt
```

In Windows, even if you install in WSL, the git integration with (say) Visual Studio Code, will break. So, I recommend simply downloading the lightweight `git-crypt` executable, and putting it in your path:

1. Download the x86_64.exe from the latest tag [here](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/tags){:target="_blank"}.
1. Rename it to git-crypt.exe and store it in a location in your path.

### Per-Repo (or Across Repos) Setup

Now you need to create a key, which you need to store securely.  You can do this _per repo_, but you can also use the same key between multiple repos. (If you've already got a key, be careful not to overwrite it!)

```bash
git-crypt init # generate the secure key
git-crypt export-key ../git-crypt-key # exports the symmetric key
```

Now **store the symmetric key securely**! If you need to decrypt your repo on another machine, you'll need to supply this key. For example, you could store the key in a password manager.

### Using Git-Crypt in Your Repo

Create `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repo (alongside your `.gitignore` file). This file tells git which files need to be automatically encrypted/decrypted with git-crypt.

For example, say you want to always encrypt your `.env` file, and all your input files are named `input.txt`. Your `.gitattributes` would look like this:

```text
input*.txt filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
.env filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
```

Now commit your `.gitattributes`.

### Parallel Encrypted Files (.enc Pattern)

For files that need to be untracked in plaintext — such as `.env`, `docs/.env`, or agent skill definitions that external tools rewrite outside Git — track a **parallel `.enc` twin** instead:

1. Ignore the plaintext file in `.gitignore` (e.g. `.env`, `docs/.env`, `/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`).
2. Encrypt `*.enc` in `.gitattributes`:
   ```text
   *.enc filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
   ```
3. Commit a companion template (e.g. `.env.template`) documenting the expected variable keys without secrets, and synchronise between plaintext and `.enc` twins when setting up or updating secrets.

### Useful Git-Crypt Commands

```bash
git-crypt status # check what will be encrypted
```

<img src="{{'/assets/images/git-crypt-status.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Git-Crypt Status" style="width:600px;" />

```bash
git-crypt status -e # show only encrypted [and should be encrypted]
```

<img src="{{'/assets/images/git-crypt-status-e.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Git-Crypt Status - Encrypted Only" style="width:600px;" />

```bash
git-crypt lock # lock all files locally. (This happens transparently on push to remote.)
git-crypt unlock [path/to/keyfile] # unlock all encrypted local files. (Transparent on pull.)
```

### Cloning an Existing Repo with Encrypted Files

For a **newly cloned repo** (e.g. on a new machine), you will need to unlock any encrypted files manually.  You can do this with `git-crypt unlock` and pass in your key. Note: you should do this rather than running `git-crypt init`, when cloning an existing repo.

```bash
git-crypt unlock ../git-crypt-key
```

### Retrospective Encryption

Of course, if you're **looking to encrypt having previously staged / committed / pushed files**, those files will not be encrypted automatically. But you can retrospectively fix this!

```bash
git-crypt status -f  # FIX, i.e. retrospectively encrypt files that were previous staged / committed
git commit -m "My retrofix"
git push
```

Caution: in this case, your git history will still contain the unencrypted versions.  You can deal with this if you want.  (If it were sensitive data you really needed to keep secret, you should definitely do this!)

### What Does It Look Like in GitHub?

After check-in and push, your input files will be visible in your GitHub repo.  But the contents of the files will not be readable.  You can download them in raw format, but if you open them, they'll look something like this...

<img src="{{'/assets/images/encrypted-input.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Encrypted Input File" style="width:600px;" />

### Some Issues You Might Face

If you happen to change the location of your git-crypt executables, then this will break git-crypt. For example, I've faced this when moving a repo from being managed in my Windows environment to being managed in my WSL environment.

In this scenario you can fix by updating `.git/config` and then updating the git-crypt settings, e.g.

```text
[filter "git-crypt"]
	smudge = \"git-crypt\" smudge
	clean = \"git-crypt\" clean
```
