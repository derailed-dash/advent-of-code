## Graph Theory Overview

Here we're talking about very specific definitions of a _graph_.  Not the kind of graph where you plot points on x and y axes, but rather: **an abstract model that represents a set of _vertices_ (also called _nodes_ or _points_), linked together by _edges_ (also called links or lines).**

### Graph Types

Graphs can be categorised as:

- **Undirected**: edges have no direction; or **directed**: edges have direction.
- **Unweighted**: edges have no magnitude; or **weighted**: edges have magnitude.

We can summarise like this:

|Graph Type|Description|E.g.|
|----------|-----------|----|
|_Unweighted Undirected ("graph")_|An associated set of unordered nodes.|![Undirected unweighted](/assets/images/undirected_unweighted.png)|
|_Unweighted Directed ("digraph")_|An associated set of ordered nodes. It is the direction of the edges (arrows) that dictates order.|![Directed unweighted](/assets/images/directed_unweighted.png)|
|_Weighted Undirected ("weighted graph")_|The edges have magnitude, and this magnitude is important.  E.g. the weight could represent distance, or cost.|![Undirected weighted](/assets/images/undirected_weighted.png)|
|_Weighted Directed ("weighted digraph")_|The edges have both magnitude and direction.  It is possible for A -> B to have a different magnitude from B -> A.|![Directed weighted](/assets/images/directed_weighted.png){:width="300"}|

It's worth noting that undirected graphs can be either unweighted and weighted; and directed graphs can be either unweighted or weightd.

### Tree

A **tree** is an **_acyclic graph_ - i.e. one in which no loops are created - where vertices are connected by exactly one path.**

However, as the image shows, a given node can appear more than once in a tree.

## Adjacency Lists

It's generally a good idea to store graphs using _adjacency lists_.  I.e. a map that links a given vertex to all the vertices it is directly connected to.

Consider the undirected graph above, where:

- 1 is connected to 2 and 5. (2 edges.)
- 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 5. (3 edges.)
- 3 is connected to 2 and 4. (2 edges.)
- 4 is connected to 3, 5, and 6. (3 edges.)
- 5 is connected to 1, 2, and 4. (3 edges.)
- 6 is connected to 4. (1 edge.)

Imagine that we're not given the overall graph, but we're instead only provided with individual edges. In this case, we can build the graph using an adjacency list as follows:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

edges = set() # store edge edge as a tuple of (node_a, node_b)

# Imagine we're only provided with the edges.
edges.add((1, 2))
edges.add((1, 5))
edges.add((2, 1))
edges.add((2, 3))
edges.add((3, 2))
edges.add((3, 4))
edges.add((4, 3))
edges.add((4, 5))
edges.add((4, 6))
edges.add((5, 1))
edges.add((5, 2))
edges.add((5, 4))
edges.add((6, 4))

# Now we build the adjacency map
node_map = defaultdict(set) # Use a set in order to filter out duplicate connections
for x, y in edges:
    node_map[x].add(y)  # a list of vertices that link to x
    node_map[y].add(x)  # a list of vertices that link to y

for vertex, connections in node_map.items():
    print(f"{vertex}: {connections}")
```

Output:

```text
1: {2, 5}
2: {1, 3, 5}
3: {2, 4}
4: {3, 5, 6}
5: {1, 2, 4}
6: {4}
```

Note:

- When we have an unweighted graph and we only one to store which nodes are adjacent to another node, we can use a dict where the key is the node, and the values are the set of adjacent nodes.
- Where we have a weighted graph and we're also interested in the magnitude of the edges, we can use a nested dictionary, where the outer key is the node, and the outer value is the inner dictionary.  The inner dict uses adjacent nodes for keys, and edge manitudes for values.
